# davecode.me
This repository controls the frontend for [davecode.me](https://davecode.me), and is worked on
exclusively by Dave Caruso. **No contributions will be accepted**. The source is made available to
show those interested more about how the system works. Do not publicly rehost or modify the code,
but rather use tricks used in code and learn how to make original web apps.

this is a very work in progress project, as i've been working on other things instead of finishing
my site. bear with me.
